### Game objects

To win the game you must find a radio station and call for help. Under the bombing runs the room was concealed in rubble.
To get there you must remove the rubble with provided and crafted tools.
To remove basic rubble you must find a shovel. Be aware, you can only carry 1 at a time! 
Opened rooms may contain supplies and crafting benches, allowing you to create new items.
To remove the heavy rubble you need to create a dynamite, which can be crafted on one of the rooms bench.
Search for ingredients and the ignition cord, which is deep inside enemy base!

Each playthrough is unique. Soldiers and crates may contain different amounts of loot.
